# Changing Places Website

This repository contains the static marketing site for Changing Places Consignment in Urbandale, Iowa. It includes the homepage, consignment form, shared styling, and assets used across both pages.

## Local Development

Because the project is built with plain HTML and CSS, you can open the files directly in a browser or serve the directory with your preferred static file server.

## Testing / Formatting

We rely on Prettier to keep the markup consistent. Run the command below before committing to verify formatting:

```bash
npx --yes prettier --check "**/*.{html,css}"
```

Use `--write` instead of `--check` to automatically fix any formatting issues.
